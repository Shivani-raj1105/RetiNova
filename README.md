# RetiNova
to run this 
install
tensorflow>=2.9.0
numpy
opencv-python
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python absl-py

Python version: 3.9–3.11 works best with current TensorFlow (3.12 support is still limited).

GPU acceleration (optional): if you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can install:

pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]


No Flask, FastAPI, or extra web frameworks needed — this CLI is pure terminal.

To then finally run this on bash
python retinova_cli.py
